Change history for django-varlet
-------------------------------------------------------------


?next?
^^^^^^
* Autocomplete outside of the tests & demo project (ie: any actual usage)
  wasn't working, and worse, was causing a ``TemplateDoesNotExist`` exception
  for the change form. See ``6b8487db38a5c0abab7af324cf05b2144f4dea67``

0.2.2
^^^^^^
* Fixed tests which broke via continuous integration, but didn't with my local
  requirements, because I'd introduced further validation in ``django-templateselector``
  See ``9834ef35189805152f1a61f6b7d02d5f4a20c06e`` for the changes.

0.2.1
^^^^^^
* Added typeahead/autocomplete to the URL field for a page.

0.2.0
^^^^^^
* Initial release
